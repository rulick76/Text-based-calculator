__Objective__: Implement a text based calculator application. Usage of Rhino, Nashorn and other similar solutions is not allowed.

__Input__: The input is a series of assignment expressions. The syntax is a subset of Java numeric expressions and operators.

__Output__: At the end of evaluating the series, the value of each variable is printed out.

####Example
Following is a series of valid inputs for the program:
```
i = 0
j = ++ i
x = i++ + 5
y = 5 + 3 * 10
i += y
```
Output:
`(i=37,j=1,x=6,y=35)`
